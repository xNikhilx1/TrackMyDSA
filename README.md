# TrackMyDSA

TrackMyDSA is a terminal-based application built in C++ to help you track your progress with solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The app allows you to:
- Add problems,
- View them,
- Mark problems as solved,
- Filter by topic, and
- See basic statistics like solved/unsolved problems.

All problem data is saved locally in a `data.txt` file.

---

## Features

- Add new DSA problems with details like title, topic, difficulty, and notes.
- View all saved problems with details such as topic, difficulty, and solved status.
- Mark problems as solved.
- Filter problems by topic.
- View statistics such as total, solved, and unsolved problems.
- Data is stored locally in a `data.txt` file.

## Built With

- **C++** – The programming language used to develop this project.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** – Utilized for storing and handling data.
- **File I/O** – Used to persist problem data in a text file (`data.txt`).
